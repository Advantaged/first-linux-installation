# Fast-Start_Function-on-WinDoof.md

The fast-start function on WinDoof (WD) OS is also known as Fast Boot, Hiberboot, or Hybrid Shutdown. This feature is 
designed to reduce boot-up times after a shutdown, making the system resume faster than a normal boot process.

To enable or disable Fast Startup, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to Control Panel.
2. Navigate to Power Options.
3. Click on "Choose what the power buttons do."
4. Click on "Change settings that are currently unavailable."
5. Under "Shutdown settings," check or uncheck the box for "Turn on fast startup (recommended)."
6. Click "Save changes."

This feature is integrated into the operating system and can be managed through the power settings menu.
