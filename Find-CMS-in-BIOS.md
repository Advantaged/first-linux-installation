# Find-CMS-in-BIOS.md

To find the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in BIOS, you typically need to **navigate through the BIOS settings 
menu**. The exact location can vary depending on your motherboard manufacturer. Here are some steps to help you locate 
CSM:

1. **Access BIOS**: When your computer starts, press the appropriate key to enter BIOS. Common keys include F2, F10, or 
Del. Refer to your motherboard manual for the specific key.
2. **Navigate BIOS Menu**: Once in BIOS, you may need to explore different tabs or sections to find CSM. Common 
locations include:
    * **Boot** tab: Look for options related to boot modes or legacy support.
    * **Advanced or Advanced Boot Options**: CSM may be listed here under options like "Launch CSM" or "CSM 
Configuration."
3. ***Enable*** **or Disable CSM**: If you find the CSM option, you can enable or disable it according to your needs. 
For example, you might need to enable CSM to boot from an older operating system or install WinDoof (WD) 7 on a UEFI 
system.

If you cannot locate CSM, it might be hidden or grayed out due to secure boot settings or other configurations. In such 
cases, you may need to disable secure boot first or consult your motherboard manual for specific guidance.

For detailed steps on enabling or disabling CSM on specific motherboards, you can refer to manufacturer-specific guides 
or forums like Tom's Hardware.
